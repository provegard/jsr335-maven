This is a small test project to demonstrate a Maven POM file that compiles
and runs tests for Java code that uses lambdas and defender methods.

The following environment variables must be set:

JDK8_HOME - path to the j2sdk-image directory of the lambda build.
DPROTO_HOME - path to the defender-prototype directory.
